## üîó Data Ingestion & Preparation (Steps 1‚Äì21)

This section outlines the full data engineering workflow ‚Äî built through Python, SQL, and PostgreSQL, orchestrated via Airflow ‚Äî that prepares the dataset for all subsequent analytics and machine learning.

1. **Database Connection:** Connect to a local PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy (`ENGINE_URL = "postgresql://postgres:CSDBMS623@localhost:5432/SP500_ML"`).  
2. **Anchor Date Setup:** Define `as_of` (evaluation date), 3-year lookback `anchor`, and a small `buffer_days` to handle weekends or holidays.  
3. **Universe Query:** Pull distinct active S&P 500 tickers from `sp500_long_latest_profiles` as of the `as_of` date.  
4. **Price Data Extraction:** Retrieve adjusted daily close prices from `sp500_prices_daily_yahoo` between `anchor - buffer_days` and `as_of`.  
5. **3-Year Return Calculation:** Compute per-ticker start/end prices around the anchor window to calculate `ret_3y = (px_end / px_start - 1)`.  
6. **Benchmark Return:** Download the S&P 500 (`^GSPC`) or SPY (total return) via `yfinance`; compute `mkt_ret_3y`.  
7. **Relative Alpha Calculation:** Compare stock vs market (`alpha_3y = ret_3y - mkt_ret_3y`), flag `beat_sp500_3y` = 1 if alpha > 0.  
8. **Income Statement Pull:** Query `income_statements_q` for TTM fundamentals and 12-month lags (`LAG()` window). Extract revenue, net income, and operating income.  
9. **Cash Flow Statement Pull:** Query `cashflow_statements_q` for TTM operating and free cash flow + lag12 versions.  
10. **Balance Sheet Pull:** Query `balance_sheets_q` for total assets and long-term debt with 12-month lags.  
11. **Earnings Surprises:** Aggregate analyst beat magnitudes ‚â•10% from `earnings_surprises_q` since 2022-09-29.  
12. **Growth Calculations:** Use helper functions (`pct_growth_plain_pospos`, `pct_growth_signed`, `growth_with_fallback`) to compute YoY % growth.  
13. **Winsorization:** Clip growth metrics to the 1st and 99th percentile to remove outliers.  
14. **Merging Fundamentals:** Join income, cash flow, and balance sheet growth tables into the unified DataFrame (`df_eda`).  
15. **Earnings Beat Integration:** Merge beat counts per symbol into `df_eda`.  
16. **Lag Handling:** Create lag columns using `add_group_lag()` for each symbol/date combination.  
17. **Growth Batch Application:** Apply growth functions across multiple variable pairs (`revenue_ttm`, `netincome_ttm`, `operatingincome_ttm`, etc.).  
18. **Data Cleaning:** Drop NaNs, replace ¬±inf with NaN, enforce numeric dtype, and filter only valid finite rows.  
19. **Decile Binning:** Use `pd.qcut()` to assign deciles by revenue growth and other key factors.  
20. **Visualization Setup:** Build heat-mapped bar charts with `TwoSlopeNorm` to highlight above/below mean return patterns.  
21. **Final Analytical Dataset:** Export the resulting DataFrame (`df_eda`) as the foundation for exploratory and ML modeling.

## üéØ Project Overview
This project applies **machine learning and data analytics** to identify the company-level indicators that consistently drive stock outperformance relative to the **S&P 500** benchmark.  
According to S&P‚Äôs Global *SPIVA U.S. Scorecard*, over **97%** of actively managed domestic funds have underperformed the market‚Äôs average return (~8% annually over the last 20 years).  
The goal here is to demonstrate that a **systematic, data-driven model** built on fundamentals, technical indicators, and macroeconomic context can detect patterns of alpha generation beyond human intuition.

---

## üß© Research Questions
- Which **fundamental** and **technical** factors most strongly influence company outperformance over time?  
- Are there certain **time periods or sectors** where growth- or momentum-driven strategies dominate (e.g., Technology vs Defensive sectors)?  
- Can a trained **ML classification model** predict the probability of company outperformance and beat the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis?

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Summary
- **Source:** PostgreSQL database (local), populated via **Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API**.  
- **Coverage:** Historical S&P 500 constituents from **Jan 2015 ‚Äì Sept 2025**.  
- **Size:** ~262,000 weekly records, >92 independent variables.  
- **Target Variable:**  
  - `Buy` (binary 1/0) ‚Üí whether a stock outperformed the S&P 500 in the following week.  
- **Feature Groups:**  
  - **Fundamentals:** Sales Growth, Free Cash Flow Growth, Operating Margin, Leverage, Liquidity, Profitability.  
  - **Technical Indicators:** RSI, Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands, Momentum, Volatility, Volume.  
  - **Macro Factors:** CPI (Inflation), VIX, Oil, Gold, Treasury Yields.  
- **Data Hygiene:**  
  - All fundamentals lagged by **one quarter** to prevent look-ahead bias.  
  - Data ingested and versioned through an **Airflow ETL pipeline**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology & Pipeline
1. **ETL & Database Automation:** Apache Airflow DAGs fetch, clean, and load data from FMP into PostgreSQL.  
2. **Feature Engineering:** Growth metrics, lag creation, normalization, winsorization.  
3. **EDA & Statistical Testing:** Decile analysis, hypothesis testing, and correlation analysis.  
4. **Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Deep Learning.  
5. **Deployment:** Streamlit app for user interaction and stock screening.

## üìä Key Analytical Findings (2022‚Äì2025)
### 1. Sales Growth is the Primary Driver  
- Top-decile sales growth firms outperformed the bottom decile by ~600%.  
- 46% of variance in returns explained by sales growth.  

### 2. Profitability and Earnings Efficiency Matter  
- Positive operating margin growth correlated with strong alpha, especially in Tech and Industrials.  
- Earnings surprises boosted returns except in rate-sensitive sectors (Real Estate).  

### 3. Momentum Sustains Performance  
- High momentum in prior years led to future outperformance (93.5% ‚Üí 35% sequential returns).  
- Outperformers spent more time above their 200-day moving average (56 vs 27 days).  

### 4. Free Cash Flow Growth Correlates with Alpha  
- Top-decile FCF growth firms outperformed by 336%.  
- T-Test p=0.06 suggests near-significant differentiation; macro volatility likely cause.  

### 5. Income Growth & Earnings Power  
- Income growth difference: 106.4% vs 25.8%; Cohen‚Äôs D=0.41.  
- Higher earnings power = greater probability of S&P 500 outperformance.
